Dear assignment checker,
We've built this project using React Native.
By React-Native's way, each project is created in both iOS and Android simultaneously, yielding a project of ~500MB.
With that in mind, we can not attach this project to Moodle nor email.

Therefore, if you'd like to view the source files, you may visit:
https://github.com/aviadhahami/Brenda.


If you wish to run the app, you may follow these instructions:
1. $ git clone https://github.com/aviadhahami/Brenda.git
2. (change into the cloned repo and) $ npm i
3. If you're running android version, type `$ react-native run android`, for iOS type `$ react-native run ios`

** IMPORTANT **
If you'd like to run on a device, you must have it connected to your machine (cable or WiFi).
-Note that if you're willing to use physical android device you must make sure you have ADB installed.
If you prefere using an emulator, make sure it is running. We recommend GenyMotion

For any questions you may contact us at: aviadhahami@gmail.com or 0544932840
If you'd like to meet us and just see the app for yourself (rather then installing etc.) it is cool too :)

Thanks!
